### EE 543 - Robot Manipulation, University of Washington, Winter 2023

EE 543 focuses on the analytical and computational methods of robot arm manipulation. The following topics is covered in this course: coordinate transformations & rigid body motions, forward & inverse kinematics, differential kinematics & manipulator dynamics, trajectory generation, motion planning, and teleoperation.

### Project Manual Robot Manipulation
This is the associated project for Robot Manipulation. In this project, students will be guided to build a robot arm with 3-4 joints from scratch. Based on EE 543 course materials, students can learn and implement:  
* Design and assemble robot arm from provided servo motors, arm links, power supply, and so on  
* Assign frames for each joint and derive proximal DH parameters  
* Apply forward kinematics and analyze the workspace of the robot  
* Solve inverse kinematics and achieve intuitive end-effector position control in Cartesian space  
* Derive the Jacobian matrix and achieve end-effector velocity control, and analyze the singularity (optional).

## Course Developer and Teaching Assistant

### Techin 512 - Introduction To Sensors And Circuits, University of Washington, 2020-2024      

[GitHub](https://github.com/GIXLabs/SAndC)  

Students will gain the background and techniques needed to connect digital systems to the physical world by learning the fundamentals of integrating sensors and microcontrollers. Students will also gain experience in the general process of sensor selection and designing hardware systems.

### Techin 517 – Robotics Lab 2 2023-2024

[GitHub](https://github.com/GIXLabs/TECHIN517/wiki/TECHIN-517%3A-Robotics-Lab-II%2C-Spring-2024)  

Applied work with robot arms and graspers, often in combination with sensors such as cameras, to perform manipulation and grasping tasks. Laboratory consists of advanced robot manipulators, configured for a series of tasks of increasing difficulty. A matching simulation environment allows student-written software to be initially partially debugged before engaging the actual robots.
