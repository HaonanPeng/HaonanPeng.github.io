I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://people.ece.uw.edu/hannaford/" target="_blank">Blake Hannaford</a>. Before that, I earned my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Blake Hannaford. I am also working with <a href="https://www.me.washington.edu/facultyfinder/per-reinhall" target="_blank">Per Reinhall</a> and <a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/ryan-jense" target="_blank">Ryan Jense</a> as cofunder of a start-up initiative.


My research interest are in surgical robotics, medical devices, and machine learning, with the overarching goal of intelligent healthcare, better closed-loop teleoperation and autonomous surgery. My work covers robotic control, manipulation, calibration, perception, motion planning, as well as AI-enhanced medical devices.
