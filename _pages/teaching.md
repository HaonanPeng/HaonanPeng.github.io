### EE 543 - Robot Manipulation, University of Washington, Winter 2023

EE 543 focuses on the analytical and computational methods of robot arm manipulation. The following topics is covered in this course: coordinate transformations & rigid body motions, forward & inverse kinematics, differential kinematics & manipulator dynamics, trajectory generation, motion planning, and teleoperation.

### Project Manual Robot Manipulation
This is the associated project for Robot Manipulation. In this project, students will be guided to build a robot arm with 3-4 joints from scratch. Based on EE 543 course materials, students can learn and implement:  
* Design and assemble robot arm from provided servo motors, arm links, power supply, and so on  
* Assign frames for each joint and derive proximal DH parameters  
* Apply forward kinematics and analyze the workspace of the robot  
* Solve inverse kinematics and achieve intuitive end-effector position control in Cartesian space  
* Derive the Jacobian matrix and achieve end-effector velocity control, and analyze the singularity (optional).
