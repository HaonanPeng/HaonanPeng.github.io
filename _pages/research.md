## Sensorless Contact Force Estiamtion

This is an ongoing project, which aim to utilize AI and data-driven models to estimate the contact force based on the original robot states, without any extra sensors. In order to collect training data of the robot states under external froce with different directions and amplitude, a cable-driven parallal robotics force actuation system is developed, which can apply force to robot arms while passively following the movement of the robot arm.
